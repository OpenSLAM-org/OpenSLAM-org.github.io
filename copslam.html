	  COP-SLAM is a highly efficient closed-form 3-D SLAM approach, It optimizes pose-chains on-line and it is compatible with g2o.
	  The COP-SLAM demo program comes with 60 kilometers of pose-chain datasets, which are obtained with visual odometry and appearance-based loop detection.

<br> <b>Long Description</b><br>
  
	  Closed-form Online Pose-chain SLAM (COP-SLAM), efficiently and accurately optimizes pose-chains,
	  in closed-form by exploiting their Lie group structure. Pose-chains are a specific type of extremely
	  sparse pose-graphs and are a product of contemporary SLAM front-ends, which perform accurate 
	  visual odometry and reliable appearance-based loop detection. They are relevant for challenging
	  robotic applications in large-scale 3-D environments for which frequent loop detection is
	  not desired or not possible.
	  It has been shown that the accuracy obtained by Closed-form Online Pose-chain SLAM is 
	  comparable to that of state-of-the-art iterative methods, while the time it needs to compute 
	  its solution is orders of magnitudes lower. This novel SLAM technique thereby is relevant to a 
	  broad range of robotic applications and computational platforms.
	  
	  The COP-SLAM demo program has no external dependencies and comes with 60 kilometers of ready-to-use pose-chain datasets.
	  The process of building and running COP-SLAM on these datasets is therefore extremely straightforward.

<br> <b>Input Data </b><br>  
	  COP-SLAM takes as input g2o pose graph files, which specify nodes and edges of a pose graph.
	  Example data sets with a total length of 60 kilometers are provided with the demo program.

<b>Further Information</b><br>
 
	  The COP-SLAM demo program is a stand-alone application. It should however be straightforward to 
	  integrate COP-SLAM with other software, e.g. with ROS. For help with this, please feel free to 
	  contact Gijs Dubbelman (gijsdubbelman@gmail.com).
